# Login

## Background
<p>
Access to the Artemis Hybrid Research Cluster (HRC) is expected to be primarily be via your browser or ssh client, and if off campus, using the VPN.
On Artemis, there is one URL for both the webfrontend as well as the SSH server: 
```
ood.artemis.hrc.sussex.ac.uk
```
</p>

## Exercises

- Log into Artemis via both your webbrowser (via the Open OnDemand Web Portal) & familiarize yourself with the landing page (check <a href="https://artemis-docs.hpc.sussex.ac.uk/artemis/access.html#open-ondemand">HERE</a> for additional information)
  - upload a file via the *Files* tab to your home directory
  - open a Jupyter notebook server
  - check the *Jobs* tab to find your running jupyter notebook server and terminate it there again

- Log successfully into Artemis via your SSH client (via *ssh* command on terminal in Linux/Unix/macOS or PuTTY on Windows)
  - find the file you uploaded via the web interface and delete it again


# Verify Server

## Background
<p>
When connecting to a remote server, there is always the chance that your connection gets intercepted and listened upon despite the connection being encrypted (''man-in-the-middle'' attack). In this exercise, we will guide you through the steps to verify that the connection is indeed secure.
