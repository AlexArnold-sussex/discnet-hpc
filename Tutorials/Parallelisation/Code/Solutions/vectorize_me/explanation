The run times t should be:

t_no-vec < t_omp-vec < t_auto-vec

The reason for auto-vectorization producing a faster code than the explicit OpenMP SIDM vectorization (with auto-
vectorization being switched off due to the -no-vec compiler arguments) is due to the additional loop for the 
initial calculation of B not being vectorized as well (cf. the omp-vec report).

Bonus: In order to fix this, you can simply add a OpenMP SIMD pragma in front of that additional inner loop as well
(or allow for a combination of OpenMP SIMD and auto-vectorization by omitting the -no-vec argument when compiling)
